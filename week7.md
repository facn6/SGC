# Week 7

## STOP

### Being late (Bobby)
- Bobby: Really important to try to arrive on time. If someone is late in the morning it means one person has to start the morning challenge/workshop by themself. Please try to be on time. 
- Kira: FYI, this week has been much better than in previous weeks. Lateness used to be a bigger problem.

### Finishing code review early (Bobby)
- Bobby: Let's take the full hour to leave issues for the other team's code. Even if you run out of constructive suggestions to write as issues, you can leave compliments. You can get a lot out of reviewing each other's code, it's a really good habit to get into.

## GO

### Working in bigger teams? (Kira)
- Ghassan: I agree, we can be more productive in bigger teams. But, at the same time, working in smaller groups gives you a chance to learn more. In this project, I learned a lot by seeing what Dana does
- Dana: It doesn’t matter if you don’t finish. It matters that you understand and that you learn something.
- Kira: Yes but if you don’t finish there will be gaps in your understanding
- Dana: Yes but you can continue working on it at the weekend
- Ayahkh: Something we’ve been missing out on is testing, because we don’t have time. If we worked in larger teams we might have more time for testing
- Bobby: Working in larger teams doesn't necessarily mean you get more done, but I can see how it would be hard to do thorough testing when there are only two of you.

**_AP_:** Check what the plan is for team sizes with Shireen before final projects

### Notify the group if you are running late (Bobby)
- Bobby: Following on from the 'Stop' about being late, if you are running late please let the group know in the WhatsApp chat
- Kira: We agreed in a previous week that we will start workshops at the time they are supposed to start, even if someone is running late
- Bobby: Ok, noted.

### Referring to line numbers when explaining code (Bobby)
- Bobby: This is another really good habit to get into. When you're presenting during a presentation, it can help you to direct your audience's attention to the right part of a code snippet. It's also a great way to talk about code without using the word 'thing' - you can refer to 'the bit of code on line X' even if you don't know what it is called or what it does.

## CONTINUE 
### Asking deep questions (Bobby)
- Bobby: It's great to hear you asking each other lots of questions

### Reading the documentation
- Bobby: Also really good to see you reading the documentation for answers. Being able to do this will come in handy after the course when you're learning new tech on your own.

### Explaining your code to each other (Bobby)
- Bobby: It's also really good that you are helping each other when you get stuck on tricky concepts. 

### Having good and motivating external speakers (Ayahkh)
- Ayahkh: - I liked the external speaker we had this week. She involved us in the conversation and she gave us good tips. She mentioned she would send us the sheet with tips on how to network? Can she still do this?(Ayahkh)

**_AP_:** Ask Shireen if Rima has shared the sheet with networking tips with her.

### Building helpful apps (Ghassan)
- Ghassan: I like that you (Kira and Ayahkh) made an application (the digital SGC board) that we can actually use. Let's make more of these useful projects!
