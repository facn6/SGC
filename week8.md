# Week 8 SGC minutes (27/29/2019)

## Workshop Review
### Intro to Express
- Aya: Although I don’t think there was anything wrong with how it was done, I didn’t understand it at the time. Only understood it when we did the workshop

### Express WS
- Sam: I missed this one, but I read through it. The workshop itself seemed quite good. One thing I wasn’t sure about was what the Morgan middleware was doing in exercise 9-10.
- Bobby: Yes, we talked about that in the classroom
- Aya: This week’s code along was so good
- Sam: re: the extra exercise we did at the end of the day


### Creating and Testing Express Routes


### Handlebars: Presentation workshop
- Faris: What are people’s opinions on Handlebars?
- Sam: Maybe it would be better to do two weeks of React instead of Handlebars in week 8?

### Research afternoon
- Aya: It was great, I think the mentors also did a good job of replacing the third topic with their own presentation
- Sam: Yeah, it was nice that even though there were only four of us, the mentors did a presentation of their own to cover the third topic.

### Handlebars MC
- General consensus was that it was good

### App Drawer MC
- Ghassan: I think the instructions were not clear enough
- Sam: Yeah, it would have helped if there were links to relevant CSS techniques (ie. how to use CSS transitions)

## SGC

## **STOP**
### Talking in languages that I don’t understand all the time
- Ghassan: The first project day, Dana and me worked remotely from home.
- Shireen: You can still come into the classroom though
- Faris: I agree, it’s still best to have face-to-face communication

## GO
### Saving research somewhere permanent
- Bobby: blah blah. Can someone please create a folder for the research?
- Ghassan: Yes I will do it
**_AP_:** GHassan to create research folder in FACN6 repo

### GitHub issues and projects
- Sam: As it’s coming up towards our bigger projects, you can use Github projects to manage your workflow and organise tasks
- Faris: I agree with you. Its important that you understand the material and learning outcomes for each week. However, I think in the future we can prompt people to explore Github projects more.

### Sharing notes/ helpful resources in Gitter
- Bobby: blah blah
- Ghassan: we do this already
- Bobby: yes ok, would be nice to see people doing it more

### Be willing to cast when your name is on the lollypop stick
- Dana: this^^

### Pair Programming
- Faris: I have noticed that you guys don’t do this much. Pair programming will provide you with a different way of thinking. Sometimes someone can spot a small error that you can’t. It doesn’t say anything about you, it’s more about learning from other people

### Speakers who work as full stack developers (as opposed to HR staff)
- Ghassan: the speakers so far have tended to work in HR teams. 
- Shireen: I agree, but it’s really hard to get people to Nazareth

### Think outside the box
- Faris: When you work on projects, you tend to go back to previous projects and copy paste. To get code working (and to actually understand why it was broken in the first place), you need to play around with it. It’s really beneficial to struggle through a problem and try new things.

## CONTINUE
### Great mentors
- Sam: It’s nice having you guys here to help. Friendly and supportive.

### Helping each other solve problems
- Aya: Asking questions 

### Say when something doesn’t make sense
- Bobby: blah blah
