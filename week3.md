### research +++++
- Dana: research was interesting this week
- Majd: you need to get the point of research, don't fill it with info that you don't actually understand yourself, it's something you do on the go and understand it quickly so you can go back to it as a reference
Try to have an example of the basics, everything I'm studying now is like research
