# Week 1

## Stop

### Flex
- Dana: stop learning flex, learned flex two days ago
- Sam: love flex
- Kira: we have to learn flex
- Sam: We should spend some more time to learn flex
- __AP__: review again next week after the MC

### competition between teams
- Kira: felt that we were competitive, maybe it wasn't a competition but there was no collaboration
- Sam: we didn't collaborate
- Ayah: do you mean when we worked today?
- Kira: no, I mean when we were working on the projects 
- Sam: we could have met halfway and talked about it
- Kira: we shouldn't hide our ideas from each other
- Shireen: you can ask the other team
- Sam: could have it in the schedule, or pitch it at some point
- Kira: could have that
- Sam: yeah, could plan better
- __AP__ Wednesday student led presentation on ideas 

### Lack of project planning
- Sam: we had issues but they didn't really know what to do, we didn't have a way of organising the files or code. we need more of a guideline that tells us how to do things 
- Majd: Try to split your work
- Sam: was hard to split the work between 3 people 
- Ayah: you're right it's because we are 3 people 
- Majd: there is some truth to what you're saying but you need to plan and split the work in a better way
- Sam: It wasn't my place to decide on everything
- Majd: the same point, when you plan your projects in a good way, it saves you time when you code. More workshops on planning will be in the future 
- Ghassan: we should be introduced to the project in the beginning of the week so we would know what to research
- Tamer: that's different
- Shireen: Plan everything and get used to this way of working
- Majd: split the issues and assign yourselves

### Using phones during SGC
- Sam: Dana was trying to make a point about using flex while using her phone
- Majd: laptops shut also means the phone

## Go

### Mobile-friendly
- Dana: more mobile-first design
- Ayah: me too, I've learned a bit but still don't actually know how to do it
- __AP__ Dana and Ghassan will research

### Review MCs the next day
- Kira: we have an hour to do them and sometimes I get stuck in the middle, what happens is I get stuck and then someone explains then I'll miss out and skip the explanation 
- Ghassan: I'm with you on that
- Kira: I can't focus on the explanantion when someone is explaining
- Ayah: me too
- Majd: Suggestion - We give a ws and I try to solve it and then finish it at home, 
- Kira: explain the solution the next day
- Ghassan: it's better if we try to solve some but not all
- Kira: this way is not working for me

### Say what we're doing at lunch
- Sam: Would be nice to say if you're doing something. Could be working on something together if we have time

### Code conventions
- Sam: I felt like I had to keep on saying that, felt like they are angry at me. 
- Ayah: Wasn't angry but was confused about git, I understand it now

### Morning/Evening work together
